- It can be seen from the summary above that the variables/coefficients that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg in the dataset are the intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance. 
- With regard to the slope of the linear model, it is clear from the coefficients values determined that it is not zero. Additionally, the p-value being lower than the significance of 0.05% shows that the slope is not zero.
- This linear regression model does effectively predict the variables that impact mpg. We can see this from the r-squared value of 0.7149. This indicates a 71% likelyhood of predicting the mpg.
